### Fed4.pic

![Fed4.pic](../images/Fed4.pic.png "Fed4.pic"){:width="640" height="400"}<br>
Main screen
{:.center}

Main screen graphic, including the curtains which open and close during the
loading screen. The tradition of naming graphics files "fed" goes back to
_Captive_; i.e. see
[Disk Directory](https://captive.atari.org/Technical/Directory/Directory.php)
at the Ultimate Captive Guide.

### Fed5.pic

![Fed5.pic](../images/Fed5.pic.png "Fed5.pic"){:width="640" height="400"}<br>
Main screen UI
{:.center}

Spritesheet for the main screen UI graphics, plus a monster. Also includes two
buffer areas for internal game use: a 64 x 55 scroll buffer, and an 80 x 76
buffer for explosions, etc. 80 x 76 is the height of the explosion graphic;
see [Ripped graphics (internal)](../data/internal-graphics.html).
One monster is also here.

### Fed8.pic

### KMAln-A.pic

![KMAln-A.pic](../images/KMAln-A.pic.png "KMAln-A.pic"){:width="640" height="400"}<br>
Monster spritesheet
{:.center}

Certain monsters only have half of their sprite drawn, to save space. The other
half of the face is drawn flipped from the sprite. A complaint about the skull
is that it always appears to be facing forward, which makes it hard to use the
strategy of sneaking around the back.
